        <p>This was my first large project, and my first time making a website from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JS. The last time I even attempted web development was in middle school, when I took a really tedious HTML/CSS basics summer program at a local high school. I had to relearn everything I'd forgotten (so, basically, I had to relearn everything), but I also got to learn cool new stuff like making procedural textures with JS and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, and the basics of JQuery and React. Once I understood the difference between margin and padding and what <code>box-sizing: border-box</code> meant, the design process flowed smoothly, and when I realized how powerful JQuery animations and the JQuery UI library were, the ideas flowed too (and so did the feature creep).</p>

        <p>As this project was always meant as more of a hands-on learning experience rather than a beautifully polished final product, and because I focused a lot more on design in the early phases (since I come from a more artistic background and it's just what I'm more comfortable with at the moment) there's a ton of jank lying around in the code, including but not limited to*:
            <ul>
                <li>JQuery fails to load sometimes
                    (idk how to fix it I've tried so hard I swear)</li>
                <li>Horrendous vestigial CSS
                    (something <strong>will</strong> break if I refactor it)</li>
                <li>Uhh... am I allowed to make JQuery calls inside a React application???</li>
                <li>Indecision regarding <code>document.getElementById("id")</code> vs. <code>$("#id")</code></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/JoonChicken/joonchicken.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/static.yml" target="_blank" aria-label="link to jank github workflow">Am I doing this right?????</a></li>
                <li>And much more!</li>
            </ul>
        So enjoy the jank while you can, until I try to make changes in five years and break everything.

        <p>Thanks to my friend Henry Ty

            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HenryTy83" aria-label="Henry Ty's Github">Github</a>&gt;
            for introducing me to the beautifully chaotic world of JavaScript because this website probably would have been static and boring otherwise.</p>

        <p>Thanks also to Scrimba for their 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e">free course on React basics!</a>
        The project manager wouldn't have been possible without this couse. Their style of interactive teaching was so great for quickly getting acquainted to React and its quirks.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tasteful animations (with reduced motion support)</li>
            <li>Beautiful handmade artistry (except for some icons)</li>
            <li>Pretentious self-flattery</li>
            <li>Draggable windows w/ automatic layering</li>
            <li>A mock file explorer to list all my projects (my first independent React app!) featuring lots and lots of words and not much else :(
                <ul><li>also has lots of easter eggs! :)</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Art gallery</li>
            <li>Custom 404 page</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Animate a rotating starry background and let the user choose between light/dark day/night themes in the unutilized interactive controls panel</li>
            <li>Add more file formats and easter eggs to the project manager</li>
            <li>Think about integrating the arts page into the project manager window [use in conjunction with the above]
                <ul>
                    <li>I decided against it for now because it seems better to have a separation between art and other projects, and because the homepage looks a bit sadder and emptier without the arts window</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
