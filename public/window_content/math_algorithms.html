            This is a collection of small Python programs I wrote for my multivariable calculus/linear algebra class in senior year of high school (which also covered parts of differential equations, something that its name fails to imply). Each program either calculates an approximate solution to a problem or provides an exact solution using a more time-consuming algorithm.

            Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to run Python code in the browser unless I transpile the files to Wasm, which seems unnecessary and likely to break numpy and matplotlib, so someday I might work on setting up Python on the Github Pages serverâ€”although I don't think Github will allow me to do that because that seems terrible for security, so maybe one day I'll get my own domain and figure out how Python sandboxing works to bring you runnable Python code on my website.

        <h2>Programs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Darcy.py</h3>
                Using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy's_law" target="_blank">Darcy's Law</a>, this program simulates a fluid flowing through consecutive sections of porous media in a single tube with a uniform cross section and outputs the steady state pressure at each section.<br />
                Pressure may or may not be uniform throughout each section, but I don't think it is so I've kept the output as a line graph.

                <h4>Params:</h4>
<pre>
area .............. cross-sectional area of the tube
segmentLengths .... array w/ lengths of each segment
k ................. array w/ permeability of each segment
mu ................ array w/ dynamic viscosity of fluid in
                    each segment
p_0 ............... pressure constraint on left end of tube
p_n ............... pressure constraint on right end of tube
</pre> <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Heat.py</h3>
                This program simulates the transfer of heat along a conductive rod by numerically solving the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation" target="_blank">Heat equation</a> with the forward finite difference method and outputs an animated graph of heat transfer in action over the length of the rod.

                <h4>Params:</h4>
<pre>
length ............ length of the rod
k ................. conductivity of the rod
temp_left ......... temperature constraint on left end of rod
temp_right ........ temperature constraint on right end of rod
total_time ........ number of time steps to run the simulation
                    for 
dx = 0.9 .......... size of subdivision of the rod
dt = 0.19 ......... size of time step
</pre> <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>LU_Decomp.py</h3>
                This program presents a computationally efficient method of calculating the determinant of a matrix by first factoring it into two triangular matricies using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition" target="_blank">Lower-Upper Decomposition</a> (more specifically <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#LU_factorization_with_partial_pivoting" target="_blank">LU factorization with partial pivoting</a>), then multiplying together all the elements in the main diagonal of the resulting upper triangular matrix to calculate the determinant of the original matrix.

                <h4>Params: <em>accepted from console input</em></h4>
<pre>
number of rows
number of columns
elements in the matrix
</pre> <br />
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>RK.py</h3>
                This program efficiently and accurately approximates a given differential equation with a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods" target="_blank">Runge-Kutta method</a> specified by a Butcher Tableau. A sample function and its derivative are provided for easy comparison.

                <h4>Params:</h4>
<pre>
xi ................ x initial; where the algorithm starts the
                    approximation
xf ................ x final; where the algorithm ends the
                    approximation
yi ................ y initial; since diffeqs describe a family
                    of functions, this y-value chooses one
dx ................ size of step in x
Tab ............... the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods" target="_blank">Butcher tableau</a> to use in this
                    approximation (includes RK4, RK3, RK38,
                    Euler, ImplicitEuler)
